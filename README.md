## 🚀 Key Highlights  

### 📊 Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values and normalized features.  
- Engineered time-series sequences for LSTM input.  
- Visualized trends (line plots), distributions (histograms), and correlations (heatmaps).  

### 🔬 Model Architecture  
- **Best Model**: Single LSTM layer (128 units) with `learning rate = 0.005` (**RMSE = 60.54**).  
- **Techniques Applied**:  
  ✅ Batch normalization and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.  
  ✅ Adam optimizer with learning rate tuning.  
  ✅ Early stopping and validation splits.  

### 📝 Experiment Insights  
| Experiment | Architecture              | RMSE   |  
|------------|---------------------------|--------|  
| 14         | 1 LSTM layer (128 units)  | 60.54  |  
| 1          | 2 LSTM layers (64, 32)    | 64.32  |  
| 15         | 2 LSTM layers (32, 16)    | 63.18  |  

**Key Takeaway**: Simpler architectures (e.g., single LSTM layer) often outperformed deeper models.

## 📊 Results  
- **Violin plots** revealed PM2.5 variance across temperature and pressure ranges.  
- **Correlation heatmaps** highlighted weak relationships between PM2.5 and features like wind speed (`Iws`).  
- Addressed vanishing gradients via batch normalization and weight regularization.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
🔹 Incorporate weather forecasts or traffic data.  
🔹 Test hybrid models (e.g., CNN-LSTM or GRUs).  
🔹 Deploy the model as a real-time air quality alert system.
