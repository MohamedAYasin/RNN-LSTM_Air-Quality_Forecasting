## 📌 Overview
- **Objective**: Forecast Beijing’s PM2.5 levels using historical air quality data.
- **Dataset**: Includes features like `DEWP`, `TEMP`, `PRES`, `pm2.5`, and weather indicators.
- **Approach**: Leveraged **LSTM networks** with hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques.
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and normalized features.
- Engineered time-series sequences for LSTM input.
- Visualized trends (line plots), distributions (histograms), and correlations (heatmaps).

### Model Architecture
- **Best Model**: Single LSTM layer (128 units) with `learning rate = 0.005` (**RMSE = 60.54**).
- Techniques Applied:
  - Batch normalization and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
  - Adam optimizer with learning rate tuning.
  - Early stopping and validation splits.

### Experiment Insights
| Experiment | Architecture              | RMSE   |
|------------|---------------------------|--------|
| 14         | 1 LSTM layer (128 units)  | 60.54  |
| 1          | 2 LSTM layers (64, 32)    | 64.32  |
| 15         | 2 LSTM layers (32, 16)    | 63.18  |

**Key Takeaway**: Simpler architectures (e.g., single LSTM layer) often outperformed deeper models.

## 📊 Results
- **Violin plots** revealed PM2.5 variance across temperature and pressure ranges.
- **Correlation heatmaps** highlighted weak relationships between PM2.5 and features like wind speed (`Iws`).
- Addressed vanishing gradients via batch normalization and weight regularization.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate weather forecasts or traffic data.
- Test hybrid models (e.g., CNN-LSTM or GRUs).
- Deploy the model as a real-time air quality alert system.
